       Hello my name is Nastassia Dudley and I'm here to present to you something like not your average hobby! My most interesting hobby is <strong>creating<em> holistic wellness</em> products</strong>. Products that I've produced and that have piqued my overall interest are those that are made of <em>all natural and organic</em> ingredients. So far i've delved into making creams, soaps, infused oils, etc. I enjoy doing this hobby particularly because it fills a bit of my sense of purpose. It is enjoyable to remedy solutions to ones problems especially when it comes to whole health and wellness. To say the least it puts comfort back in ones life to be able to have an ideal skin care regimen that will allow for a sense of healing and relaxation.

        As you can imagine a holistic wellness hobby can have a wide array of categories that may be handcrafted by just about anyone. So simple that anyone can enjoy this hobby recipe!  Infusing oils, for example, may only take a few steps depending on the creative's preference in method and style. First step is preparation. You will need the following to get started:<ul><li>glass jars with lids or corks,</li><li>non-metalic implement, ie. wooden spoon</li><li>a light carrier oil such as olive or almond,</li><li>a strainer or muslin cloth,</li><li>and labels</li></ul><img src="images/fio.jpg" alt="Flower infused in bottle of oil" height="148" width="200" /></br>As I've mentioned there may be a few different methods to take into consideration. You can either infuse oils naturally via indoor countertop, sunlight, or boil the oil and herbs stove top style. If you're limited on time then check out the you tube video by SauceRobert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AEI62-3ecE&t=2s">Infused Oil: Make Your Own At Home!!!!</a>. For the sake of natural I chose the more natural method. In this case I chose olive oil and place it in a mason jar. I've added hibiscus and rosemary to the previously cleansed jar using the wooden implement, spoon, or whatever you may like to use in order to get the herbs pushed all the way down in the jar. Cap the jar lid on the jar tightly. Let sit for three to six weeks or longer if you so choose. By the end of the six weeks the infusion is ready to be sifted via the muslin cloth as it works as a strainer. After straining the oil from the herbs you will need to squeeze the muslin cloth to rid of any excess liquids that might still be attached to the herb or overflow from the remaining fluid in the jar. Once the oil has been strained and transferred to another clean receptacle then you may add a fresh herb and/or flower to the new decorative jar. You may decide to use a more of a fancier looking jar for aesthetic reasons. The oil will look really nice in a tall thinner jar so as the herbs may be a bit easier viewed in its entirety. Cork the bottle and you're done.

        Additionally, if you would like to take this hobby a step further and you think you may want to make this in bulk or gift to friends and family then you may wan to decide to heat seal the top of the jar with a heat gun and plastic heat wrap so as the product retains its freshness and will be much easier to transport to its prospective owner during your travels. I've listed some links to a couple videoes and online resources that anyone can check out in order to further develop their skills in this hobby. Take a sneak peak on the simplest and safest ways to get started! aromaculture.com provides a blog post about the oil infusion process and various methods... <a href id="<https://www.aromaculture.com/blog/infused-oils">Everything You Need To Know About Infusing Herbal Oils</a></p>
